The burger app allows users/clients to keep a database of hamburgers. It allows to keep track of a list of hamburgers available to the client for consumption, or a list of hamburgers the user plans to try in the future. The user can add new hamburgers to the list. In addition, once eaten any of them, the user has the ability to move the specific hamburger to a list of consumed hamburgers.
